<dl class="gloss">

  <dt id="glo:absolute-path">absolute path</dt>
  <dd>
    A <a target="glo:path">path</a> that refers to a
    particular location in a file system.  Absolute paths are usually
    written with respect to the file system's <a target="glo:root-directory">root directory</a>, and begin with
    either "/" (on Unix) or "\" (on Microsoft
    Windows).
    See also:
      <a target="glo:relative-path">relative path</a>
  </dd>

  <dt id="glo:absolute-reference">absolute reference</dt>
  <dd>
    A <a target="glo:spreadsheet">spreadsheet</a> cell reference that
    is not automatically adjusted when a formula is moved from one
    location to another.  Absolute references are created by putting
    <code>$</code> in front of the row and/or column designation, as in
    <code>$C$4</code>.
    See also:
      <a target="glo:relative-reference">relative reference</a>
  </dd>

  <dt id="glo:abstract-data-type">abstract data type (ADT)</dt>
  <dd>
    A specification of a set of values, and the operations that can
    be performed on them.  The term "abstract" means that
    the implementation of the ADT is hidden from other code.
  </dd>

  <dt id="glo:abstract-syntax-tree">abstract syntax tree (AST)</dt>
  <dd>
    A data structure that represents the structure of a program or
    program fragment.  Its leaves are literals, such as numbers and
    variable names, while its internal nodes represent higher-level
    structures, such as loops and expressions.
  </dd>

  <dt id="glo:access-control">access control</dt>
  <dd>
    A way to specify who has permission to view, edit, delete, run,
    or otherwise interact with something, by explicitly listing what
    rights each individual or group has.  This is in contrast with the
    standard Unix <a target="glo:authorization">authorization</a> mechanism, which only
    allows a fixed set of privileges to be listed for owner, one
    group, and everyone else.
  </dd>

  <dt id="glo:access-control-list">access control list (ACL)</dt>
  <dd>
    A list that explicitly describes who can do what to a file,
    directory, or other entity.  ACLs permit finer control over a
    computer's resources than Unix's classic user/group/all system,
    but are more complicated to administer.
  </dd>

  <dt id="glo:acid">ACID</dt>
  <dd>
    An acronym for atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable, which
    are the properties that a <a target="glo:transaction">database

    adding or averaging.
  </dd>

  <dt id="glo:algorithmic-complexity">algorithmic complexity</dt>
  <dd>
    The rate at which the work performed by an algorithm grows as a
    function of problem size, ignoring constant factors.  Algorithmic
    complexity is usually expressed using <em>O</em>-notation; for
    example, the time required to compare each value in a list to each
    other value is <em>O(N<sup>2</sup>)</em>.
  </dd>

  <dt id="glo:alias">alias</dt>
  <dd>
    A second (or subsequent) reference to a single piece of data.
    Aliasing can make programs more difficult to understand, since

  <dd>
    The step in a software development process in which developers

  <dt id="glo:anchor">anchor</dt>
  <dd>
    An element of a <a target="glo:regular-expression">regular
    expression</a> that matches a location, rather than a sequence

  </dd>

  <dt id="glo:assertion">assertion</dt>
  <dd>
    An expression which is supposed to be true at a particular
    point in a program.  Programmers typically put assertions in their
    code to check for errors; if the assertion fails (i.e., if the
    expression evaluates as false), the program halts and produces an
    error message.
  </dd>

  <dt id="glo:asymmetric-cipher">asymmetric cipher</dt>

  <dd>
    In <a target="bib:make">Make</a>, a variable whose value is automatically

  <dt id="glo:basic-authentication">basic authentication</dt>
  <dd>
    A simple username/password <a target="glo:authentication">authentication</a> mechanism that is part

  <dd>
    Python (and some other programming languages) automatically
    convert Windows-style line endings (carriage return followed by

    half at each step, just as a person would go to the middle of a

    and so on.  These conventions are <em>not</em> enforced by most
    operating systems: it is perfectly possible to name an MP3 sound
    file <code>homepage.html</code>.  Since many applications use filename

  <dt id="glo:long-integer">long integer</dt>
  <dd>
    An integer whose value takes up as many words of computer
    memory as necessary.  Most programming languages use 32 bits to
    represent integers, which permits values in the range
    <em class="math">-2<sup>31</sup>...2<sup>31</sup>-1</em> (or -2147483648 to
    2147483647).  In contrast, a language will allocate as many words
    of computer memory to a long integer's value as that value needs.
    The advantage is that very large values can be represented and
    manipulated; the disadvantage is that operating on such values is
    much slower than operating on native ones.

  <dt id="glo:shell">shell</dt>
  <dd>
    A command-line user interface program, such as Bash (the

    commonly execute a read-evaluate-print cycle: when the user enters
    a command in response to a prompt, the shell either executes the
    command itself, or runs the program that the command has
    specified.  In either case, output is sent to the shell window,
    and the user is prompted to enter another command.  Most shells
    include commands for looping, conditionals, and defining

  <dt id="glo:simple-api-for-xml">Simple API for XML (SAX)</dt>
  <dd>
    A stream-oriented way to process XML documents.  Instead of
    presenting the document as a tree, SAX presents it as a sequence
    of events, such as "start of element",
    "text", and "end of element".  The
    application programmer is responsible for writing functions to
    handle each type of event.  Its main advantage is that it does not
    require programs to store entire documents in memory.  The
    disadvantage is that any moderately complex application therefore
    winds up building some sort of tree in memory anyway.

  <dt id="glo:twos-complement">two's complement</dt>
  <dd>
    A way to represent signed integers in computer memory.  The most
    significant bit in positive integers is 0; the other bits are used
    to store magnitude.  Negative values "wrap around",
    like a car's odometer, so that -1 is the bit string 111...111,
    -2 is 111...110, and so on, all the way to the most negative
    number, which is 100...000.  Note that two's complement is
    asymmetric: since zero counts as a positive number, the absolute
    value of the most negative number is one greater than the absolute
    value of the most positive number.  Put another way, N bits can
    represent values from <em class="math">-(2<sup>N-1</sup>)</em> to
    <em class="math">2<sup>N-1</sup>-1</em>.  Thus, three bits can represent the
    integers -4...3.

  <dt id="glo:version-number">version number</dt>

    A multi-part number used to identify a software release.

    patch 3, build 1407.  By convention, the major number is only
    incremented when changes make this version incompatible with
    previous versions.  Minor version numbers are for
    backward-compatible releases that add new features, while patches
    usually identify partial releases (typically, bug fixes).

  <dt id="glo:virtual-machine">virtual machine (VM)</dt>
  <dd>
    A program that makes a computer behave as if it were some other
    type of computer.  Many modern programming languages, such as Java
    and Python, run on virtual machines, rather than directly on the
    computer's hardware.  The main advantages are portability (once
    the VM has been ported to a new machine, all of the programs
    running on it will also run on that machine) and security (the VM
    can enforce much more complicated safety rules than today's
    hardware).  The main disadvantage is speed: since the VM may have
    to execute several physical instructions to simulate a single
    logical instruction, programs running on a VM may be many times
    slower than programs running natively.
